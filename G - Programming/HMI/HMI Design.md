# HMI Design

## Quick Tip

The key to HMI design is to make it a "dumb" operator.  All the "smarts" should be programmed into the MCU.  For instance, timers and counters may be initiated by an HMI, but the MCU should perform/monitor the calculations.  

## Software Requirements

The HMI requires the Nextion Editor.

## Navigation

The HMI can navigate between different "pages" or "screens" which can be used to organize the contents of the user interface.
