Two boards were created:

1) Full control board with entire system
2) Backup peripheral-only board in case we run into issues with the MCU



We burned up two H-bridges while testing the motor.  Due to long lead times of the L298N, we decided to try and design an H-bridge using transistors and diodes.  Initial testing shows that this will work.
